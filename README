* Changes from vanilla M2TW (with 1.3 patch):

- Ship movement speed 3x
- Diplomat movement speed 2x
- Princess movement speed 1.75x
- Campaign movement speed 1.75x for all units (ships, diplomats, princesses's stats are stacked)
- Spy recruitment cost 3x
- Spy upkeep cost 3x
- Allow a settlement to recruit 2 agents of the same type in a single turn.
- Remove corruption trigger based on high treasury
- Gold/silver-only mining mod:
    - Only gold and silver are mineable.
    - All existing gold and silver resources on the main campaign map (not New World) have been replaced with chocolate and silk, respectively. Each faction now has 1 gold resource at its capital and 1 silver resource at its secondary region (or both at capital if the faction starts out with only 1 region).
    - The point of this mod is to make each faction's capital and secondary region (if applicable) very valuable. There is an incentive to take an enemy faction's capital before taking their other settlements, for example. It also levels the playing field for those factions without valuable mineable resources, because gold and silver are no longer concentrated in regions like Zagreb/Vienna.
    - To reinforce the idea that gold/silver can only benefit the owner of the region, their trade value has been drastically reduced (to 2 and 1, respectively).
    - The New World regions still have all of their gold/silver resources, which makes them extremely valuable. Vanilla M2TW made taking the New World regions very boring, but now at least there is an incentive (lots of money!).
    - For kicks, Rome has 3 gold resources! This makes capturing Rome very tempting...
    - The redundant "Mining Network" building has been removed, since the regular mines alone make enough money.
- All building constructions take 1 turn
- The more expensive the building, the more it costs. See the comment in the export_descr_buildings.txt file for details. The cheapest building (which costs 400) is the same, but the most expensive ones (15000) cost almost 2x more.
- Give free upkeep slots to castles (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)
- All free upkeep slots 2x (castles stacked)
- Increase recruitment slots from
      city:   1, 2, 2, 3, 3
      castle: 1, 2, 3, 3, 3
  to
      city:   1, 2, 3, 4, 5
      castle: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- For each building type (walls, barracks, stables, ports, etc.), let all levels of that building recruit the same units. However, we give the more advanced buildings bonuses to base unit number, recruitment points gained per turn, maximum recruitment points available, and (most importantly) the starting experience.
- Rebel spawn rate 20x lower
- Pirate spawn rate 20x lower
- King's purse 2x
- Fixed faction standing bug
- City/Castle defense tower activation range 8x
- Walls and gate HP 5x
- Tower HP 2x
- Bodyguard soldiers (cavalry and infantry types) reduced 0.5x; costs reduced accordingly
- Missile infantry ammo 2x
- Pikemen units: fix rubber swords bug (pikemen only use pikes, not their weak secondary swords)
- Basic infantry have free upkeep (mental up to 5 AND cost up to 650)
- Unlock all playable factions
- Reduce "distance to capital" penalty by 75%
- Reduce "religious unrest" penalty by 50%
- Disable all mission penalties
- Disable the "cease hostilities" mission
- Fix guild_assassin_payback bug (10 gold (obvious typo) instead of 100 gold) in descr_missions.txt
  NOTE: This may be a silent bug (AFAIK I've never encountered it), but it's still a bug nevertheless.
- Increase every mission's monetary reward (the higher the reward, the greater the increase); see descr_missions.txt for details.
- Fix council_min/mod_money bug in descr_missions.txt (the lines starting with "    cash ..." were not correctly mapped to their intended paybacks)
    - Also, increase the cash threshold 10x for triggering the major/mod/min money rewards (since quicksilver's other modifications make it so that the player has a large cash reserve most of the time).
- Increase every mission's military rewards 3x
- Decrease every mission's duration by 33% (except for the "convert" mission where you have to convert a settlement's religion)
- Papal States no longer capture rebel settlements (helps land-strapped factions like Milan and Sicily expand into Africa more easily)
- Disable graphics cap during battle (where your reinforcements are denied entry into the battlefield because of M2TW's opinion of your graphics hardware capabilities)
- Reduce random heretic/witch spawn rate by 75%
- Reduce heretic/witch max (allowed on campaign map) by 75%
- Reduce inquisitor denounce success rate by 50%
- Improve priest denouncing power (against heretics/witches) 2x
- Improve effectiveness of assassins 2x
- Assassin's minimum success chance changed from 5% to 17% (1 out of 6, just like rolling a die; so a newbie assassin should be able to succeed more easily), and maximum chance changed from 95% to 99%

Misc (non-substantive) changes:
- Disable diplomat/princess diplomacy animations from the campaign map
- Disable forced combat closeups (gate/wall is destroyed or enemy general is killed)
